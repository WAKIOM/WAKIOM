# Hello, I'm Wakio ðŸ‘‹

I'm a data analyst from Kenya. A passionate data enthusiast who discovered the joy of working with data
and decided to pursue it wholeheartedly. My journey into the world of data began with curiosity,
and it didn't take long for me to realize how much I loved the process of extracting insights from raw information.
I was fascinated by the power of data to drive decisions and transform businesses. I decided to dedicate my time learning all about data,
from the fundamentals to the tools. Now i am very proficient in Excel and SQL. Working on Python, Tableau and Power BI.
